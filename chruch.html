<p>Simla was all forest when the first Europeans came to these hills in 1820s.</p>
<p> There were two or three dilapidated shepherd's huts and a small "Hanuman temple" situated on the Jakhoo Hill.</p>
 <p>The Europeans sought permission on the Raia of Keonthal, from whose state much of simla was later carved out, to build residences. Captain (later Major) Charles Kennedy was the Political Agent of the British Government posted in these hill states. He built the first house and the estate known as Kennedy House in late 1820s. Later Lord Amherst, the Governor General came to Simla for a summer trip in the year 1827 and stayed in the Kennedy House. By 1830s about sixty houses were raised for the British Visitors and Simla became a health resort for them.
