<p>Highlights of Se Cathedral
This is the largest church in the old city of Goa and even in Asia. It was built in 1562, and its white exterior walls and interior decoration are quite plain. The gilded screen behind the altar depicts the life and tragic end of St. Catherine. There is a hidden chapel on the right side of the church, also known as the "Church of Miracles of the Cross", where you can see a cross that is said to become very large. There is also the largest clock tower in Asia, and you can see the golden clock when you climb it.</p>
