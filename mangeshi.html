<p>One of the oldest and most-visited temples of Goa, Mangeshi Temple is dedicated to Lord Mangesh, an incarnation of Lord Shiva. The presiding deity is worshipped in the form of a shiva lingam which was brought to Goa by the Saraswat Brahmins. In 1560, the Christianisation of Salsette Taluka led to the transfer of the deity to the present-day Priol in Atrunja Talika. The key highlight of the temple is the seven-storey deepstambha which is a sight to behold when lit with earthen lamps at night.</p>
