The name Kufri is derived from the word kufr meaning "lake" in the local language. The highest point in the surrounding region, Kufri has a Himalayan wildlife zoo that hosts rare antelopes, felines, and birds including the Himalayan monal, the state bird of Himachal Pradesh until 2007. During winter a meandering path through the potato plantations turns into a popular ski track.</p>
