<p>Dharamshala is a town in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh.</p>
<p>It serves as the winter capital of the state and the administrative headquarters of the Kangra district since 1855.</p>

References to Dharamshala and its surrounding areas are found in ancient Hindu scriptures such as Rig Veda and Mahabharata. The region was under Mughal influence before it was captured by the Sikh empire in 1785. The East India Company captured the region for the British following the First Anglo-Sikh War of 1846, from when it became part of the British Indian province of the Punjab. Post Indian Independence in 1947, it remained as a small hill station. </p>
