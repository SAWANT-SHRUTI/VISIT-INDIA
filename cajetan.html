<p>History Behind the Church of St. Cajetan
The Church of St. Cajetan was commissioned to be built by Italian monks who belonged to the Order of Theatines. While the construction began in 1655, it was ready only by 1661. Attached to the church is the Convent of St. Cajetan which is home to the Pope Pius X Institute – a place for the pastoral training of priests.</p>
